= Music Programming Language

== What is Music Programming?
// TODO

== Goals
* Build around the Indian Classical Music model
* High-level -- focus on musical constructs rather
  than more generic audio constructs

=== Explicit Non-Goals
* Support for general-purpose programming
  constructs (data structures, functions, etc.)
* Extensibility to models of music other than
  Indian Classical

== The Music Model
As mentioned earlier, this language will be
built around the Indian Classical music model.
This means that constructs like _gamakam_ will
have first-class support, while constructs like
chords will take a back seat.
